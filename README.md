# dune-rules-de: German rules for the board game Dune 

The board game Dune (2019) has a high complexity, which is unfortunately only increased by vaguely formulated rules.
In addition, the rules are distributed among the manual, cards and FAQs on the Internet.

This rules collection aims to reduce the complexity for players by re-wording and re-ordering the rules.
The rules are published using GitHub Pages.

Our group speaks German and our physical edition is in German, so this rules collection is also in German.
