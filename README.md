# dune-rules-de: German rules for the board game Dune 

The board game Dune (2019) has a high complexity, which is unfortunately only increased by vaguely formulated rules.
In addition, the rules are distributed among the manual, cards and FAQs on the Internet.

This German rules collection aims to reduce the complexity for players by re-wording and re-ordering some of the rules.
